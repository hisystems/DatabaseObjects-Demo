<h1><strong>Welcome to the DatabaseObjects demonstration</strong><br>
</h1>
<p>This program provides some examples of the different ways the DatabaseObjects
  library can be used. Currently, the
  DatabaseObjects
  library
  can
  successfully connect to SQL Server, Microsoft Access and MySQL databases. If
  you would like me to add another database feel free to send me an email - <a href="mailto:toby@hisystems.com.au">toby@hisystems.com.au</a>.
  By default the
  program will connect to the <strong>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VB98\nwind.mdb </strong>  database.
  The nwind.mdb database is available at the Microsoft website <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=C6661372-8DBE-422B-8676-C632D66C529C&displaylang=EN" target="_blank">here</a> should
  you need it. If you would like to test with SQL
  Server uncomment
  the
  NorthWindDB.Connect_SQLServer
  function in frmMain and change the database server if necessary. Or to test
  with MySQL extract the mysql version of the northwind database from <a href="../../../../data/mysql_northwind.zip">data/mysql_northwind.zip</a> into
  the data directory and uncomment the NorthWindDB.Connect_MySQL function in
  frmMain. To view all
  of the SQL statements that are being executed, turn
  on
  the DebugSQL compilation
  option in the DatabaseObjects project. </p>
    <p>The source code for DatabaseObjects and the demonstration project are currently 
        hosted on <a href="https://github.com/hisystems/DatabaseObjects-Demo">Github</a>.</p>
<p>The .NET version provides a number of  classes that further improve the usefullness
  and speed with which classes can be created. See the DatabaseObjects, DatabaseObjectsEnumerable,
  DatabaseObject and DatabaseObjectUsingAttributes MustInherit/abstract classes.
  These classes still implement the IDatabaseObjects
  and IDatabaseObject interfaces
  but implement the
  basic
  functionality that they require, and provide a simpler, more convenient and
  intuitive use of the library. <br>
</p>
<h3>1. Search Products</h3>
<p>Demonstrates how to implement the SearchCriteria
function in the Products class.</p>
<h3><br>
  2. Search Products (Extended)</h3>
<p>Demonstrates a more complex set of search criteria as opposed
  to the simple search demonstrated in the 'Search Products' window.
  It also demonstrates joining tables (in this case the Products table
  and
  the Supplier table) to optimise the loading speed of the products, in addition
  to demonstrating how to load a
Product and Supplier object from the same database record.</p>
<h3><br>
  3. View an Order</h3>
<p>Demonstrates an implementation for a <em>header </em>and associated<em> detail</em> table.
  In this example, with the Orders and OrderDetails tables.</p>
